# cmw-uc

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The purpose of this workspace is to demo the use of mocking API requests using [mock-service-worker (msw)](https://mswjs.io/) with [storybookjs](https://storybook.js.org/) for working with components that make API requests in isolation and mocking the response of these API requests for demo.

## install the dependencies

```bash
npn install
```

## running storybook

```bash
# with npx
npx nx storybook client
# with the nx cli
nx storybook client
```
